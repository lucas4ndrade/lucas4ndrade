### Hy there! 👋

- 👨‍💻 I'm Lucas, a backend software engineer and GOLang fan. I mainly work with business logics to create optimized, scalable and clean applications (mostly APIs)
- 🔭 I'm a **huge** fan of backend technologies that are, at the same time, performative and good to use, so i'm currently working mostly with GOLang, RabbitMQ, Elasticsearch and MongoDB
- 👯 I always aim to give back to the GOLang community, so me and my current company work hard to expose some of the solutions and features we develop to the public.
